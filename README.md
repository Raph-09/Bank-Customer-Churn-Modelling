# Bank-Customer-Churn-Modelling

# Description
The aim of this project is to predict if a customer will exit the bank or not. I made use of features such as credit score, geography, gender, tenure, age, balance, has credit card, is active and estimated salary for the prediction.
The following steps where followed;
1) Feature Engineering: missing values where handled
2) Exporatory data analysis:The data was analyzed and explored so I can understand how the different variables relate to customers churn
4) Feature Scaling: standard scaler was used
5) Artificial Neural Network(ANN)
